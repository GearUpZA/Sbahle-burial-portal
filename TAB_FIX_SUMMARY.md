# SBS-V14 Tab Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Global Variable Scope Issues (CRITICAL FIX)**
**Problem**: Variables `payouts` and `penalties` were declared with `let` instead of `window.` making them local scope instead of global.

**Solution**: 
- Changed `let payouts = [...]` to `window.payouts = [...]`
- Changed `let penalties = [...]` to `window.penalties = [...]`
- Updated all functions to use `window.payouts`, `window.penalties`, etc.

### 2. **Missing Tab Initialization Calls (CRITICAL FIX)**
**Problem**: When switching tabs, the content wasn't being populated because the appropriate display functions weren't being called.

**Solution**: Added proper function calls in `adminTab()` and `memberTab()`:
- **Admin tabs**: Added `updateAdmin()` for overview tab
- **Member tabs**: Added `updateMember()` for profile tab
- All other tabs were already properly configured

### 3. **Data Persistence Issues (MODERATE FIX)**
**Problem**: The `saveDataToStorage()` function was trying to save undefined global variables.

**Solution**: Updated to use `window.` references with fallbacks:
```javascript
members: window.members || [],
beneficiaries: window.beneficiaries || [],
payouts: window.payouts || [],
penalties: window.penalties || []
```

### 4. **Member Dashboard Global References (MODERATE FIX)**
**Problem**: Member dashboard functions were using local variable references instead of globals.

**Solution**: Updated all member functions to use `window.` prefixed variables:
- `window.tempBeneficiaries`
- `window.currentUser`
- `window.members`, `window.beneficiaries`, etc.
